                The Pitstop Partner application is a multidimensional database that makes the workforce efficient and guarantees a smooth flow in the doorstep car services offered. It consists of systematic, step by step procedures right from the inspection of the vehicle till the time the vehicle is ready to hit the road. The app ensures a continuous connectivity between the customer, the service advisor and the manager.<br><br>

                <h4 style="color:#00BFFF;"><b>Objectives of the app</b></h4>
                 The app encompasses and fulfils the 5 core principles of Pitstop

                  <h5><b>INTEGRATED CRM-</b></h5><p>Since written and verbal transactions are subject to discrepancies, the pitstop partner app uses technology to record and store every detail about the servicing process. This reduces time consumption and makes car servicing convenient for both the customer and the service advisor.</p></div>



                  <div style="margin-top:85px">
                  <img src="/Users/prashant/Desktop/products/B2B/features/REAL TIME UPDATES.png" height="170px" width="200px"></div>
                  <div style="margin-top: -130px; margin-left: 300px;">
                  <h5><b>TIME UPDATES-</b></h5>The quotation section of the app ensures fair pricing offered by pitstop and also gives the customer the freedom to either accept or reject it. The service advisor is saved from the hassle of negotiations.</div>
